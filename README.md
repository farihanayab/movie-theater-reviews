MVP Goals:

- As a visitor I want to be able to click "Login with Google" to access features the app offers it users.
- As a user, I want to see all the reviews added.
- As a user, I want to be able to add, delete and edit my review.


# Next Steps

- Future enhancement one: I would make a star rating, where the User can rate the theaters from 1 to 5 where 1 is the lowest rating and 5 is the highest. 

- Future enhancement two: I would like to add multiple reviews for one theater.
